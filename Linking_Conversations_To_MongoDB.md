# ðŸ”¥ Plan of Attack

Assess Current Storage & Data Flow

Check MongoDB for excessive or redundant data (db.collection.stats(), db.collection.totalSize()).
Review how old conversations are retainedâ€”do we need an auto-cleanup policy?
Monitor resource usage (docker stats and docker logs for any memory spikes).
Optimize Data Retention

Implement TTL indexes in MongoDB to auto-delete old records after a set time.
Limit the stored conversations per user/session instead of keeping everything indefinitely.
Review API Handling

Ensure the API is handling requests efficiently and not storing duplicate/unnecessary data.
Introduce pagination or batch retrieval for chat history instead of loading everything at once.
Scale Backend if Needed

Increase memory allocation for MongoDB within Docker.
Offload older conversations to a secondary database or external storage (e.g., S3 for long-term storage).
Connect to HatGPT & Debug Interactions

If HatGPT sessions are bloating the system, we need to determine:
How session data is stored and retrieved.
Whether inactive sessions can be archived or offloaded.
If thereâ€™s a memory leak causing excess retention.
Automation & Monitoring

Set up automated alerts for high memory usage (htop inside WSL, docker stats, or Prometheus monitoring).
Implement a periodic cleanup script to keep MongoDB lean.
Immediate Next Steps
Check MongoDB's current storage (db.stats(), db.collection.stats(), db.collection.countDocuments({})).
Investigate how HatGPT sessions are linkedâ€”where is the excess memory use coming from?
Start testing TTL indexes and conversation limits.
ðŸš€ Sound like a solid plan? We can tackle the specifics once we get an overview of the memory issue.

ðŸ”¥ Next Steps: Integrate HatGPT Sessions with MongoDB
Ensure MongoDB Can Handle Everything

Confirm the current schema and adjust as needed.
Remove any constraints that could limit storage (like small field sizes or capped collections).
Modify Backend to Store HatGPT Sessions

Capture full session details (timestamps, user ID, message history, metadata).
Ensure each session is uniquely identifiable.
Store data as-is without trimming or purging.
Set Up API to Query HatGPT Data

Create a /sessions endpoint to retrieve past HatGPT conversations.
Implement filtering (by date, session ID) so you can search past interactions.
Test & Monitor

Load test with bulk data to check if any issues arise (db.stats(), db.collection.stats()).
Watch memory usage (docker stats, htop inside WSL).
Ensure queries donâ€™t slow down as data scales.
ðŸ”¥ Immediate Action Plan
âœ… Modify Backend: Start capturing HatGPT sessions directly into MongoDB.
âœ… Expose API Endpoints: So we can later retrieve and analyze session data.
âœ… Test at Scale: Load up data and ensure the system remains stable.

If storage becomes a concern down the road, weâ€™ll deal with it then, but for now, we focus on capturing everything. ðŸš€
